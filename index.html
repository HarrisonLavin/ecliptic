      :ECLIPTIC is an adaptation of Alderac Entertainment Group's card game <strong>Love Letter</strong>, programmed entirely in JavaScript.  Plugins and libraries used include jQuery and jQuery UI.<br><br>
      To play, drag a card from your hand into the center of the playfield.  The game will recognize the value and effects of the card, and enact them on your A.I. opponent.  Should either player be eliminated before the end of the round, their opponent scores one point.  <br>
      If, at the end of the round, both players are still present, the player with the higher value card wins the round.  First player to 7 points is the winner.
